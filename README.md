In this lab, you are expected to make an integrated geovisualization, which should describe a geographic event with maps and charts. To make this geovisualization, we will use a storytelling library [webslides](https://webslides.tv/). Before you make your own geoviz, the instructor will go over the template with you. ([check here](https://jakobzhao.github.io/geog4572/labs/lab03//index.html)).
